        "A stack operates on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates: the last plate you put on top is the first one you take off. Common operations are `push` (adding an element) and `pop` (removing an element). An example where a stack is useful is in function call management. When a function is called, its context is pushed onto the call stack. When it returns, its context is popped off.\n\nA queue, on the other hand, operates on a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Think of a line at a ticket counter: the first person to join the line is the first person to be served. Common operations are `enqueue` (adding an element) and `dequeue` (removing an element). An example is managing print jobs. The first document sent to the printer is the first one to be printed."
